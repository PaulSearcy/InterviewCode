# Purpose

A repository to showcase the varied languages, platforms, and tools I've used to solve various problems throughout my career. 

Coding tests that are algorithmic based or conducted in a short time frame inside an interview are not ideal for myself. I've created this as an alternative to showcase and walkthrough what code I've written, what it solves, and why.
